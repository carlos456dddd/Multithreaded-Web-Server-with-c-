# Multithreaded-Web-Server-with-c++

This is a personal project focused on a language that interests me, as well as a review of internal aspects to strengthen my knowledge. I have no set limits for its development, and it is purely educational from my perspective. To maintain a completely natural approach, I will not use AI assistance for writing the .md file. I want to keep it entirely original, meaning that the explanations will be written solely by me. References to the books used for each section will be provided, along with some reviews of the books, to offer my opinion on them. I'm not trying to criticize academic material, but rather to shorten the path for anyone reading this repository so that, if they're considering reading any of these books, they'll consider some tips. It's not just about learning the C++ language, but also about protocols and things we often overlook and don't really understand how they work internally. To make things more natural, I'll create diagrams manually, mainly so I can remember them myself, and if they're helpful to someone else, that's fine too. Many of the examples I'll use won't be overly technical, but rather presented in a way that makes complex concepts more accessible.
